# Use a video as a 3D skybox

1. Create a panorama movie.

2. Add a background component.

3. Add a video component to the scene and use the panorama as the video source and the background component as a texture target.

## Skybox lights with videos

Currently, you can't use videos for [skybox lights](../graphics/lights-and-shadows/skybox-lights.md).

To create matching lighting for a video background, use a screenshot from the video, or blend between several screenshots.
