# Get started with Stride

<span class="badge text-bg-primary">Beginner</span>

Welcome to Stride! This chapter provides everything you need to start creating games using the Stride game engine. If you're new to Stride, we recommend starting with the [Install Stride](install-stride.md) guide, which will help you set up the engine and get you ready for development.

Stride is designed for game developers who want a powerful, flexible, and open-source engine for their projects. Whether you're an experienced developer or just starting out, these guides will walk you through the basics and help you get up and running quickly.

For video tutorials, have a look at the [Tutorials](../../tutorials/index.md).

If you're interested in building the Stride engine from source or contributing to its development, please refer to the instructions on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/stride3d/stride).
