With the **Stride launcher**, you can install, manage and run different versions of Stride.

## Install the latest version of Stride

If you don't have Stride installed, the Stride Launcher prompts you to install the latest version.

If you choose to install the latest version, the Stride Launcher asks if you want to install the Stride Visual Studio extension.

The Stride Visual Studio extension adds syntax highlighting, live code validation, error checking, and navigation. It also lets you you [edit shaders directly from Visual Studio](../graphics/effects-and-shaders/custom-shaders.md). You don't need to install the extension to use Stride, but we recommend it, especially for programmers.

## Manage different versions of Stride

You can install multiple versions of Stride and launch them from the Stride Launcher.

You might need to use an older version of Stride to work with old projects. Newer versions of Stride might contain changes that require old projects to be upgraded.

For minor versions, only the last number of the version number changes (1.9.0, 1.9.1, 1.9.2, etc). Minor versions don't contain breaking changes, so they're safe to install and use with your existing projects.

>[!Note]
>You can't revert to earlier minor versions. For example, you can install both Stride 1.9 and 1.8 side by side, but you can't revert from Stride 1.9.2 to Stride 1.9.1.
