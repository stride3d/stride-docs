    After the installer closes, Stride creates shortcuts in locations you selected and the **Stride Launcher** opens.

    The Stride Launcher prompts you to install the latest version of Stride.

    Click **Yes**.

10. The Stride Launcher asks if you want to install the Visual Studio integration. This lets you edit shaders directly from Visual Studio and provides syntax highlighting, live code analysis with validation, error-checking, and navigation. Installing the integration isn't mandatory, but we recommend it.

    Click **Yes**.
    
12. The Stride Launcher checks if the prerequisite **Visual C++ Redistributable** is installed. If it's not installed, follow the prompts to install it.

13. The Stride Launcher checks if the prerequisite **Build Tools for Visual Studio** is installed. If you have Visual Studio, then this is already installed. If it's not installed, follow the prompts to install it.

    >[!Note]
    > Windows uses the Visual Studio installer to install **Build Tools for Visual Studio**, but it doesn't install Visual Studio.

Stride is now installed and ready to use.

>[!Note]

> If you don't install the prerequisites, Stride won't run. In this case, you can download and install the prerequisites separately. For instructions, see [Troubleshooting â€” Stride doesn't run](../troubleshooting/stride-doesnt-run.md).

> Alternatively, uninstall Stride, restart the Stride installer, and install the prerequisites when prompted.
