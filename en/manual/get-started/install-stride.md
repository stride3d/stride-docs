# Install Stride

<span class="badge text-bg-primary">Beginner</span>

## Introduction

If you want to **create games using Stride**, this guide provides the installation steps you'll need to follow. You'll need to install the Stride installer and launcher. The Stride installer is approximately **55 MB** and is downloaded directly from our main GitHub repository.

The installer will automatically download and install the prerequisites if they are not detected, including the [Stride Launcher](launch-stride.md), which is essential for downloading and installing the latest version of Stride for game development.

If you're interested in **building the Stride engine from source** or **contributing to its development**, please visit the [Stride GitHub repository](https://github.com/stride3d/stride) for instructions on how to build from source and contribute to the project.

**Prerequisites (automatically installed if not present):**

- Latest **.NET SDK** supported by Stride
- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable

The **Stride Launcher** will download and install the latest version of Stride.

    > [!Warning]
    > If the .NET SDK has never been installed on your machine, the .NET SDK installation window might appear below the Stride installation window. Please check step 12 for details and be prepared to manually continue the .NET SDK installation.

    Click **Install**.

13. The Stride Launcher asks if you want to install the Visual Studio integration. This allows you to edit shaders directly from Visual Studio, providing syntax highlighting, live code analysis with validation, error-checking, and navigation. Installing the integration isn't mandatory, but we recommend it.

> [!Note]
>  **Stride Launcher:** If you click **Start** and see an error message such as `Could not find a compatible version of MSBuild.` or `Path to dotnet executable is not set.`, close the Stride Launcher and restart it. This issue is caused by the Stride Launcher not detecting the .NET SDK installation. Restarting the Stride Launcher should resolve the issue. Alternatively, restart your computer.

> If you don't install the prerequisites, Stride won't run. In this case, you can download and install the prerequisites separately. For instructions, see [Troubleshooting â€” Stride doesn't run](../troubleshooting/stride-doesnt-run.md).

> Alternatively, uninstall Stride, restart the Stride installer, and install the prerequisites when prompted.
