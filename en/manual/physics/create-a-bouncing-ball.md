In this tutorial, we'll use the [static collider and rigidbody components](colliders.md) to create a ball bouncing on a floor.

>[!Note]
>The screenshots and videos in this tutorial were made using an earlier version of Stride, so some parts of the UI, and the default skybox and sphere, might look different from your version.

## 1. Create a new project

Start a **New Game** project.

The default scene comes pre-loaded with five entities: Camera, Directional light, Skybox, Ground, and Sphere. We're going to add physics components to the **Ground** and **Sphere** entities.

## 2. Add a static collider
   
Let's begin by adding a [static collider](static-colliders.md) component to the Ground entity. A static collider is a physics object that doesn't move. Typical static colliders are walls, floors, large rocks, and so on. In this case, the static collider will give the ball something to bounce on.

1. Select the **Ground** entity.

2. In the **Property Grid**, click **Add component** and select **Static Collider**.

3. Set the [collider shape](collider-shapes.md) to match the shape of the entity. To do this, in the **Property Grid**, expand the **Static Collider component** to view its properties.

4. Next to **Collider Shapes**, click ![Green plus button](~/manual/game-studio/media/green-plus-icon.png) (**Add**) and select **Infinite Plane**.

    This adds a static collider to the ground, so the ball has something to bounce off.

## 3. Add a rigidbody collider

Next, we'll add a [rigidbody](rigid-bodies.md) component to the sphere. A rigidbody is a physics object that moves â€” perfect for our bouncing ball.

1. In the **Scene Editor**, select the **Sphere** entity.

2. In the **Property Grid**, click **Add component** and select **Rigidbody**.

3. Just like we did for the Ground entity, set the [collider shape](collider-shapes.md) to match the entity. To do this, in the **Property Grid**, expand the **Rigidbody component** to view its properties.

4. Next to **Collider Shapes**, click ![Green plus button](~/manual/game-studio/media/green-plus-icon.png) (**Add**) and select **Sphere**.

## 4. Position the ball

Let's position the sphere so it starts in mid-air and falls to the ground.

1. Select the **Sphere** entity. 

2. In the **Property Grid**, under **Transform**, set the **Position** to: _X: 0, Y: 6, Z: 0_

    ![Change Sphere position](media/physics-tutorials-create-a-bouncing-ball-change-sphere-position.png)

    This places the ball in mid-air above the ground.

## 5. Position the camera

Now we'll move the camera to give us a good view of the scene. 

1. Select the **Camera** entity. 

2. In the **Property Grid**, under **Transform**, set the **Position** to: _X: -12, Y: 7, Z: 9_

3. Set the **Rotation** to: _X: -20, Y: -50, Z: 0_

    ![Change camera position](media/physics-tutorials-create-a-bouncing-ball-change-camera-position.png)

    You can see preview the camera view in the **Camera preview** in the bottom-right of the Scene Editor.

## 6. Set the restitution

Let's see what the scene looks like so far. To run the project, press **F5**.

![Falling ball](media/physics-tutorials-create-a-bouncing-ball-falling-ball.gif)

The Sphere (rigidbody) responds to gravity and falls. The Ground (static collider) breaks its fall. But there's no bounce effect yet.

To create a bounce effect, we need to change the **restitution** of the Sphere and the Ground. This simulates the [coefficient of restitution (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_restitution) of real-world collisions. 

* If the restitution property of colliding entities is 0, the entities lose all energy and stop moving immediately on impact. 
* If the restitution is 1, they lose no energy and rebound with the same velocity at which they collided. 
* If the restitution is higher than 1, they gain energy and rebound with *more* velocity. 

As a rule, to create realistic collisions, set the restitution between 0 and 1.

Let's set the restitution of our Sphere and Ground entities.

1. Select the **Sphere** entity.

2. In the **Property Grid**, under **Rigidbody**, set the **Restitution** to 0.8.

    ![Set restitution for a sphere](media/physics-tutorials-create-a-bouncing-ball-restitution-of-a-sphere.png)

3. Select the **Ground** entity.

4. In the **Property Grid**, under **Static Collider**, set the **Restitution** to 0.5.

    ![Set restitution for the ground](media/physics-tutorials-create-a-bouncing-ball-restitution-of-the-ground.png)

To see how this changes the physics, run the project again (**F5**). This time, the ball bounces on the ground before coming to a stop:

![Bouncing effect](media/physics-tutorials-create-a-bouncing-ball-falling-and-bouncing-ball.gif)

Try changing the restitution of both entities to 1. This creates a ball that bounces indefinitely, losing no energy:

![Infinite bounce](media/physics-tutorials-create-a-bouncing-ball-infinitely-bouncing-ball.gif)

Set the restitution to 1.1 and the ball bounces a little higher each time:

![Ball bouncing higher](media/physics-tutorials-create-a-bouncing-ball-higher-and-higher.gif)

Now we've created a bouncing ball, we can use it to learn about triggers. For more information, see the [Script a trigger](script-a-trigger.md) tutorial.
