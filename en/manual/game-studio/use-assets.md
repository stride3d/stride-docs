# Use assets

<span class="label label-doc-level">Beginner</span>

There are three ways to use assets:

* reference them in entity components
* reference them in other assets
* load them from code as content

## Reference assets in components

Many kinds of component use assets. For example, model components use model assets. 

Components that use assets have **asset docks** in the **property grid**.

To add an asset to an entity component, drag the asset to the asset dock in the component properties (in the **property grid**). You can drop assets in the text field or the empty thumbnail.

Alternatively, click ![Hand icon](~/manual/game-studio/media/hand-icon.png) (**Select an asset**).

![Select an asset](media/use-assets-asset-picker.png)

The **Select an asset** window opens.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Select an asset** window only displays assets of types expected by the component. For example, if the component is an audio listener, the window only displays audio assets.

After you add an asset to a component, the asset dock displays its name and a thumbnail image.

## Reference assets in other assets

Assets can reference other assets. For example, a model asset might use material assets.

You can add asset references to assets the same way you add them to entity components (see above).

## Clear a reference

To clear a reference to an asset, in the **asset dock**, click ![eraser](media/use-assets-eraser.png) (**Clear reference**).

## Examine references

You can see the references in a selected asset in the **References** tab. By default, this is in the bottom right of Game Studio.

* The **References** tab displays the assets referenced by the selected asset. 
* The **Referenced by** tab displays the assets that reference the selected asset.

> [!Tip]
> If you can't see the References tab, make sure it's displayed under **View > References**.

## Load assets from code
When loading in assets at runtime we speak of "Content" rather than assets. The loaded content refers to the asset and can then be used in your script.

```cs
// Load a model (replace URL with valid URL)
var model = Content.Load<Model>("AssetFolder/MyModel");

// Create a new entity to add to the scene
Entity entity = new Entity(position, "Entity Added by Script") { new ModelComponent { Model = model } };

// Add a new entity to the scene
SceneSystem.SceneInstance.RootScene.Entities.Add(entity);
```

> [!TIP]
> To find the asset URL, in Game Studio, move the mouse over the asset. Game Studio displays the asset URL in a tooltip.  URLs typically have the format *AssetFolder/AssetName*.

> [!WARNING] 
> When loading assets from scripts, make sure you: 
> * include the asset in the build as described in [Manage assets](manage-assets.md)
> * make sure you add the script as a component to an entity in the scene

### Unload unneeded assets

When loading content from code, you should unload content when you don't need them any more. If you don't, content stays in memory, wasting GPU.

To do unload an asset, use ``Content.Unload(myAsset)``.
