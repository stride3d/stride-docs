You can move around the scene and change the perspective of the editor camera. The XYZ axes in the bottom left show your orientation in 3D space.

## Move around in the scene

There are several ways to move the editor camera around the Scene Editor.

> [!TIP]
> Holding the **Shift** key speeds up movement.

### Fly

</video>

Hold the **right mouse button** and **move the mouse** to change the camera direction. Hold the **right mouse button** and use the **WASD keys** to move. This is similar to the controls of many action games.

### Pan

Hold the **right mouse button** and the **center mouse button** and move the mouse.


### Dolly

</video>

To dolly (move the camera forward and backward), use the **mouse wheel**.


### Orbit

Hold **Alt** and the **left mouse button** and move the **mouse**.

The point of rotation is always the center of the screen. To adjust the distance to the center, use the **mouse wheel**.

### Focus on an entity

                <source src="media/navigate-in-scene-focus-on-entity-using-f-key.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

After you select an entity, press the **F** key. This zooms in on the entity and centers it in the camera editor.

You can also focus by clicking the **magnifying glass icon** next to the entity in the Entity Tree.

> [!TIP] 
> Focusing and then orbiting with **Alt + left mouse button** is useful for inspecting entities.

### Controls

Action                 | Control
-----------------------|--------------
Move                    | Arrow keys + right mouse button <p><br>WASDQE keys + right mouse button </p></br><p>

## Change camera editor perspective

You can change the camera editor perspective using the **view camera gizmo** in the top-right of the Scene Editor.

### Snap camera to position

To change the angle of the editor camera, click the corresponding face, edge, or corner of the **view camera gizmo**.

Click    | Camera position
---------|--------------
Face     | Faces the selected face
Edge     | Faces the two adjacent faces at a 45° angle
Corner   | Faces the three adjacent faces at a 45° angle

## Camera options

> [!Note]
> This page explains how to use the Scene Editor camera. For information about how to use cameras in your game, see [Graphics — Cameras](../cameras/index.md).

To display the Scene Editor camera options, click the **camera icon** in the top-right of the Scene Editor.

### Perspective and orthographic views

**Perspective view** is a "real-world" perspective of the objects in your scene. In this view, objects close to the camera appear larger, and lines of identical lengths appear different due to foreshortening, as in reality.

In **orthographic view**, objects are always the same size, no matter how far their distance from the camera. Parallel lines never touch, and there's no vanishing point. It's easy to tell if objects are lined up exactly in orthographic view.

You can also switch between perspective and orthographic views by clicking the **view camera gizmo** as it faces you.

#### Field of view

You can change the camera field of view. This changes the camera frustum, and has the effect of zooming in and out of the scene. At high settings (90 and above), the field of view creates stretched "fish-eye lens" views. The default setting is 45.

#### Near and far planes

The near and far planes determine where the camera's view begins and ends.

* The **near plane** is the closest point the camera can see. The default setting is 0.1. Objects before this point aren't drawn.

* The **far plane**, also known as the draw distance, is the furthest point the camera can see. Objects beyond this point aren't drawn. The default setting is 1000.

Game Studio renders the area between the near and far planes.

#### Camera speed

The **camera speed** setting changes how quickly the camera moves in the editor.
