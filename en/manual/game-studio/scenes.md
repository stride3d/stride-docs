**Scenes** are the levels in your game. A scene is composed of **entities**, the objects in your project.

The screenshot below shows a scene with a knight, a light, a background, and a camera entity:

Scenes are a type of [asset](/assets.md). As they are complex assets, they have a dedicated editor, the **Scene Editor**.
