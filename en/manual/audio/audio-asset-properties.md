| Property | Description
|----------|----------
| **Source** | The source audio file (note that Stride never alters source files)
| **Compression ratio** | Set the compression rate from `1` (no compression) to `40` (maximum). Greater compression optimizes memory use, but decreases audio quality. Stride compresses audio files with the open-source [Opus/Celt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CELT) codec.
|**Sample rate** | The rate at which Stride [resamples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)#Sampling_rate) the source file. The higher the sample rate, the higher the audio quality. Typical sample rates are 44.1 kHz (44,100 Hz), 48 kHz, 88.2 kHz, and 96 kHz. Note that high sampling rates doesn't improve the quality of low-quality audio files.       
| **Spatialized**  | Simulate 3D audio (see [spatialized audio](spatialized-audio.md))
| **Stream from disk** | Streaming is useful for larger audio files, as it saves memory. For more information, see [Stream audio](stream-audio.md).
