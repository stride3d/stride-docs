# Profiling

<span class="label label-doc-level">Beginner</span>
<span class="label label-doc-audience">Programmer</span>

You can **profile** your project to check its runtime performance and find problems. Use the Stride **Game Profiler** script or an external profiling tool such as the Performance Profiler in Visual Studio.

## Profile with the Stride **Game Profiler** script

The **Game Profiler** script shows how performance costs change at runtime. This helps isolate bottlenecks and find their cause.

![Profiler at runtime](media/profiling-profiler-at-runtime.jpg)

To use the script:

1. In the **Asset View**, click ![Add new asset button](media/profiling-add-new-asset-button.png) and select **Scripts > Game Profiler**.

    ![Add Game Profiler script](media/profiling-add-game-profiler-script.png)

2. The **New script dialog** opens. Leave the default information and click **Create script**.

    ![New script](media/create-profiler-script.png)

    Game Studio adds the GameProfiler script to your project.

3. Add the script to an entity. For instructions, see [Use scripts](../scripts/use-a-script.md).

4. Select the entity that contains the **GameProfiler**.

5. In the **Property Grid** (on the right by default), enable the **Game Profiler** component.

    ![Enable component](media/enable-profiler-component.png)

    >[!Tip]
    >You can also enable and disable the profiler at runtime with **Left Ctrl + Left Shift + P**.

6. Run the game.

    The Game Profiler shows profiling results as your game runs.

    >[!Note]
    >Game Profiler disables VSync. This gives you the true profiling values, ignoring sync time.

### Game Profiler properties

To change the Game Profiler properties, select the **GameProfiler** entity and use the **Property Grid**.

![Profiler properties](media/profiler-properties.png)

| Property | Description
| -------- | --------
| Filter | The kind of information the profiler displays (FPS only, CPU, or GPU). At runtime, change with **F1**.
| Sort by | Sort the result pages by: <br><p>**Name**: the profile key (the thing being profiled) <br><p>**Time**: the key that uses the most time <br><p>At runtime, toggle with **F2**.
| Refresh interval (ms) | How frequently the profiler gets and displays new results. At runtime, control with **- / +**.
| Display page | The results page displayed. At runtime, jump to a page with the **number keys**, or move forward and backwards with **F3** and **F4**.
| Text color | The color of the profiler text
| Priority | See [Scheduling and priorities](../scripts/scheduling-and-priorities.md)

### Understanding the Game Profiler results

The top row displays information about basic performance.

![FPS profiling](media/fps-profiling.png)

* `Displaying`: the kind of information the profiler displays (FPS only, CPU, or GPU)
* `Frame`: the current frame
* `Update`: the average time (ms) taken to update the game since the profiler last refreshed
* `Draw`: the average time (ms) taken to render the frame since the profiler last refreshed
* `FPS`: the average number of frames rendered per second

If you select **CPU** as the display mode, the profiler displays:

![CPU profiling](media/fps-cpu.png)

* `Total`: the amount of memory currently used
* `Peak`: the peak memory use since the game started
* `Allocations`: the amount of memory allocated or freed since the profiler last refreshed
* `Gen0`, `Gen1`, `Gen1`: the number of garbage collections per each generation of object (`Gen0` is the most recent generation)

If you select **GPU** as the display mode, the profiler displays:

![GPU profiling](media/fps-gpu.png)

* `Device`: the graphics device (manufacturer's description)
* `Platform`: the currently used backend (eg DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan, etc)
* `Profile`: the feature level for your game, set in **Game Settings > Rendering** (see [Game settings](../game-studio/game-settings.md))
* `Resolution`: the game resolution
* `Drawn triangles`: the number of triangles drawn per frame
* `Draw calls`: the number of draw calls per frame
* `Buffer memory`: the amount of memory allocated to buffers 
* `Texture memory`: the amount of memory allocated to textures

In the **GPU** and **CPU** modes, the profiler displays information about the parts of the code being profiled, including active scripts.

![Profiler columns](media/profiler-columns.png)

>[!Note]
>Each value describes the events per frame since the last profiler refresh.

Column  | Description
--------|--------
`TOTAL` | The total time taken to execute the code in one frame
`AVG/CALL` | Average time taken to execute a single call of the code
`MIN/CALL` | The shortest amount of time taken to execute a single call of the code
`MAX/CALL` | The longest amount of time taken to execute a single call of the code
`CALLS` | The number of times the code was executed in one frame
`MARKS` | The number of times per frame marked code is executed. This column is only displayed if marked code is executed
`PROFILE KEY / EXTRA INFO` | The part of the code (such as a function or script) being profiled. This column also displays additional information, such as the number of entities affected.

### Game Profiler runtime controls

You can change the Game Profiler settings at runtime using keyboard shortcuts.

Action  | Control
--------|--------
Left Ctrl + Left Shift + P  | Enable/disable the profiler
F1 | Toggle between CPU, GPU, and FPS-only results
F2 | Toggle between sorting by profile key and time
- / +  | Slow down / speed up the refresh time
F3 / F4 | Page back / page forward
Number keys | Jump to a page

### Use the Game Profiler in code

* Enable profiling:

    ```cs
    GameProfiler.EnableProfiling();
    ```

* Enable profiling only for the profiler keys you specify:

    ```cs
    GameProfiler.EnableProfiling(true, {mykey1,mykey2});
    ```

* Enable the profiling except for the profiler keys you specify:

    ```cs
    GameProfiler.EnableProfiling(false, {mykey1,mykey2});
    ```

* To access the prolifing key of a script, use [ProfilingKey](xref:Stride.Engine.ScriptComponent.ProfilingKey).

## Use external profiling tools

Instead of using the Stride Game Profiler, you can use external profiling tools to profile your project.

| Profiler | Type | Platforms
| ---- | ---- | -----
| [Visual Studio profiler](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt210448.aspx) | Visual Studio feature | Desktop and mobile 
| [Xamarin Profiler](https://www.xamarin.com/profiler) | Standalone tool distributed with Xamarin Studio | Mobile 
| [RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org/builds) | Standalone | Desktop and mobile

### Use the Visual Studio profiler

Visual Studio has powerful in-built profiling tools that can identify common performance issues.

1. In Visual Studio, open your project solution (`.sln`) file.

2. To open the profiler, press **Alt + F2**, or in the task bar click **Analyze > Performance Profiler**.

    ![Launch Visual Studio profiler](media/profiling-profiling-in-visual-studio-start-profiler.png)

3. In the **Profiler** window, select the profiling tools you want to run.

    ![Launch Visual Studio profiler](media/profiling-profiling-in-visual-studio-gpu-cpu-profiling-launch.png)

    You can run multiple profiling tools at once.

4. To launch the profiler, in the Performance Profiler tab, at the bottom, click **Start**.
   
   ![Profiler Start button](media/profiler-start-button.png)
    
    Visual Studio runs your application and begins profiling.

For more information about the Visual Studio profiler, see the [MSDN documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt210448.aspx).

### Use RenderDoc

RenderDoc is a free MIT licensed stand-alone graphics debugger that allows quick and easy single-frame capture and detailed introspection of any application using Vulkan, D3D11, OpenGL & OpenGL ES or D3D12 across Windows 7 - 10, Linux, Android, or Nintendo Switchâ„¢.

1. Download [RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org/builds).

2. Optional: This step is optional and only necessary if you want to have render pass markers with name following the Graphics Compositor:

   2.1. In your executable project (Windows), locate `game.Run();` and insert the following code just before:

   ```cs
   game.GraphicsDeviceManager.DeviceCreationFlags |= DeviceCreationFlags.Debug;
   ```
   >[!Note]
   >If you have a `SharpDXException` of type `DXGI_ERROR_SDK_COMPONENT_MISSING`, please follow the instructions from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/gaming/use-the-directx-runtime-and-visual-studio-graphics-diagnostic-features

   2.2. Also, make sure profiler is enabled by calling this code from any of your game script:

    ```cs
    GameProfiler.EnableProfiling();
    ```

3. Optional: Add a package reference to `Stride.Graphics.RenderDocPlugin`.

   You can then use the @'Stride.Graphics.RenderDocManager' class to trigger captures:
   
   ```cs
   var renderDocManager = new RenderDocManager();
   renderDocManager.StartCapture(GraphicsDevice, IntPtr.Zero);
   // Some rendering code...
   renderDocManager.EndFrameCapture(GraphicsDevice, IntPtr.Zero);
   ```

## Common bottlenecks

As CPU and GPU process different types of data, it's usually easy to identify which part is causing a bottleneck.

Most GPU problems arise when the application uses expensive rendering techniques, such as post effects, lighting, shadows, and tessellation. To identify the problem, disable rendering features.

If instead there seems to be a CPU bottleneck, reduce the complexity of the scene.

For graphics:

* decrease the resolution of your game
* reduce the quality of your [post effects](../graphics/post-effects/index.md)
* reduce the number of lights and size of [shadow maps](../graphics/lights-and-shadows/shadows.md)
* reduce shadow map sizes
* use culling techniques to reduce the number of objects and vertices rendered

For textures:

* use [compressed textures](../graphics/textures/compression.md) on slower devices
* use sprite sheets, not individual images
* use texture atlases, not separate textures
