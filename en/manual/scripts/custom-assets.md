# Creating Custom Assets

Stride supports the creation of custom asset types that can be referenced in your scenes as well as reference other assets.
To do so, you must add a reference to the `Stride.Core.Assets` package in your game's `.csproj`:
Here's how it looks like in a default game project:
```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFrameworks>net8.0-windows</TargetFrameworks>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Stride.Engine" Version="4.2.0.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Stride.Video" Version="4.2.0.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Stride.Physics" Version="4.2.0.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Stride.Navigation" Version="4.2.0.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Stride.Particles" Version="4.2.0.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Stride.UI" Version="4.2.0.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Stride.Core.Assets.CompilerApp" Version="4.2.0.1" IncludeAssets="build;buildTransitive" />

    <PackageReference Include="Stride.Core.Assets" Version="4.2.0.1" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```
> [!Warning]
> Make sure that the version specified for `Stride.Core.Assets` matches the other package's versions.

Inside the same project, create a new csharp file and replace its content with the following:
```cs
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Stride.Core;
using Stride.Core.Assets;
using Stride.Core.Assets.Compiler;
using Stride.Core.BuildEngine;
using Stride.Core.Serialization;
using Stride.Core.Serialization.Contents;
using Stride.Engine;

namespace YOUR_GAME_NAMESPACE;

/// <summary>
/// Runtime representation of the asset, this is the actual class you would use in your scripts
/// </summary>
[DataContract]
[ContentSerializer(typeof(DataContentSerializerWithReuse<YOUR_CLASS>))]
[ReferenceSerializer, DataSerializerGlobal(typeof(ReferenceSerializer<YOUR_CLASS>), Profile = "Content")]
public class YOUR_CLASS
{
	// Replace this with whatever you would want this asset to hold at runtime
    public List<Prefab> PrefabCollection { get; set; } = new();
}

/// <summary>
/// Design time and file representation of <see cref="YOUR_CLASS"/>, you can add content here that won't be included in the build
/// </summary>
[AssetDescription(FileExtension, AllowArchetype = false)]
[AssetContentType(typeof(YOUR_CLASS))]
[AssetFormatVersion(nameof(YOUR_GAME_NAMESPACE), CurrentVersion, "1.0.0.0")]
public sealed class YOUR_CLASS_ASSET : Asset
{
    private const string CurrentVersion = "1.0.0.0";
    public const string FileExtension = ".blks";

	// Replace this with whatever you would want this asset to have while inside the gamestudio
    public List<Prefab> PrefabCollection { get; set; } = new();
}

/// <summary> Compiler which transforms your <see cref="YOUR_CLASS_ASSET"/> into <see cref="YOUR_CLASS"/> when building your game </summary>
[AssetCompiler(typeof(YOUR_CLASS_ASSET), typeof(AssetCompilationContext))]
public sealed class YOUR_CLASS_COMPILER : AssetCompilerBase
{
    protected override void Prepare(AssetCompilerContext context, AssetItem assetItem, string targetUrlInStorage, AssetCompilerResult result)
    {
        var asset = (YOUR_CLASS_ASSET)assetItem.Asset;

        // you can have many build steps, each one is running an AssetCommand
        result.BuildSteps = new AssetBuildStep(assetItem);
        result.BuildSteps.Add(new DESIGN_TO_RUNTIME_COMMAND(targetUrlInStorage, asset, assetItem.Package));
    }

    public override IEnumerable<ObjectUrl> GetInputFiles(AssetItem assetItem)
    {
        // Yield assets that must be built before this one is built,
	// this is for cases were you need to read from a compiled version of an asset to build this one.
	// Note that creating cyclic references through this method will cause a deadlock when building
	// (e.g.: A is input of B while B is input of A)

	// below only for reference purposes, useless in this context
        var asset = (YOUR_CLASS_ASSET)assetItem.Asset;
        foreach (var block in asset.PrefabCollection)
        {
            var url = AttachedReferenceManager.GetUrl(block);

            if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(url))
            {
                yield return new ObjectUrl(UrlType.Content, url);
            }
        }
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// An <see cref="AssetCommand"/> that converts design time asset into runtime asset.
    /// </summary>
    public class DESIGN_TO_RUNTIME_COMMAND(string url, YOUR_CLASS_ASSET parameters, IAssetFinder assetFinder)
        : AssetCommand<YOUR_CLASS_ASSET>(url, parameters, assetFinder)
    {
        protected override Task<ResultStatus> DoCommandOverride(ICommandContext commandContext)
        {
            var assetManager = new ContentManager(MicrothreadLocalDatabases.ProviderService);

            var runtimeObject = new YOUR_CLASS{ PrefabCollection = Parameters.PrefabCollection };
            assetManager.Save(Url, runtimeObject);

            commandContext.Logger.Info($"Saving {nameof(YOUR_CLASS)}: {runtimeObject.PrefabCollection}");

            return Task.FromResult(ResultStatus.Successful);
        }
    }
}
```

> [!Warning]
> Every changes made to the runtime asset will break previously built asset databases, make sure to delete the build artifacts stride generates for assets (`YOUR_PROJECT.Windows/obj/stride` and `bin/db`) after changing the class to make sure the asset database is fully rebuilt on the next build.

This takes care of the support for this asset, you could create a `*.blks` file inside your `Assets` directory and fill in the content manually, but might as well do it through the editor ...

## Adding a section for the Add asset menu inside the editor

Create a new directory named `Templates` within your Game's directory, this directory will be used to store your templates.
Inside of that directory, create a new file named after your new asset with the `.sdtpl` extension.

![Template directory example](media/template-directory-example.png)

Open the file and paste the following into it
```
!TemplateAssetFactory
Id: 21CC3354-9F0B-4D1F-8242-62D56454B27C
AssetTypeName: YOUR_CLASS_ASSET
Name: THE NAME IN THE EDITOR
Scope: Asset
Description: A DESCRIPTIVE DESCRIPTION OF YOUR ASSET
Group: WHERE THIS WOULD BE CLASSIFIED UNDER IN THE EDITOR
DefaultOutputName: THE DEFAULT FILE NAME
```
Edit the different fields appropriately,
- `Id` must be unique ! There are a couple of services online to generate one if you need to, search for `generate guid online`
- `AssetTypeName` must match the name of the class that inherits from `Asset` (the namespace can be omitted)

Now you have to edit your `*.sdpkg` to include this new template, to do so you just have to add the following lines below your `TemplateFolders:`
```
TemplateFolders:
    - Path: !dir Templates
      Group: Assets
      Files:
        - !file Templates/YOUR_TEMPLATE.sdtpl
```
Here's how it looks like when included into a default game `*.sdpkg`:
```
!Package
SerializedVersion: {Assets: 3.1.0.0}
Meta:
    Name: MyGame21
    Version: 1.0.0
    Authors: []
    Owners: []
    Dependencies: null
AssetFolders:
    -   Path: !dir Assets
    -   Path: !dir Effects
ResourceFolders:
    - !dir Resources
OutputGroupDirectories: {}
ExplicitFolders: []
Bundles: []
TemplateFolders:
    - Path: !dir Templates
      Group: Assets
      Files:
        - !file Templates/YOUR_TEMPLATE.sdtpl
RootAssets: []
```

And you're finally done, have fun !
