# Set the graphics platform

<span class="label label-doc-level">Beginner</span>

The **graphics platform** controls the graphics hardware in the device you run your project on. Different devices support different graphics platforms; for example, iOS supports the OpenGL ES graphics platform. You can select which graphics platform your game uses, and add overrides for different platforms (eg Windows, Android, etc).

>[!Warning]
>Moving from Direct3D to an earlier Direct3D version can create problems. For example, if your game contains HDR textures, it will crash, as Direct3D 9 doesn't support them.

You set the graphics platform in the [game settings](../game-studio/game-settings.md) asset.

> [!Note]
> Make sure you have the latest drivers for the graphics platforms you want to use.

1. In the **Asset View**, select the **Game Settings** asset.

2. In the Property Grid, under **Rendering Settings > Target graphics platform**, select the graphics platform you want to use.

    If you select **Default**, Stride uses the graphics platform appropriate for your platform (eg Windows, Android) when you build.

| Platform      | Default graphics platform 
|---------------|-------------
| Windows, UWP  | Direct3D11  
| Linux, Mac OS | OpenGL    
| Other         | OpenGL ES  

## Override the graphics platform

You can override the graphics platform Stride uses for specific platforms. For example, you can have Linux use Vulkan while other platforms use the default.

1. With the **GameSettings** asset selected, in the Property Grid, under **Overrides**, click ![Green plus button](~/manual/game-studio/media/green-plus-icon.png) (**Add**).

    Game Studio adds an override.

2. In the new override, next to **Platforms**, select the platforms you want this override to apply to.

3. In the **Configuration** drop-down menu, select **Rendering Settings**.

4. Under **Rendering Settings**, in the **Preferred Graphics Platform** drop-down menu, select the graphics platform you want to use.

Stride overrides the graphics platform for the platforms you selected.

## Check which graphics platform your project uses

1. Add a break point to your game code (eg in a script).

2. Run the project. 

3. Check the value of the [GraphicsDevice.Platform](xref:Stride.Graphics.GraphicsDevice.Platform) variable.

    For example, this project is using Vulkan:
