In Stride, a project refers to a game project. You can create new games, new packages, and play sample games.

After you create a new project in the Stride Interactive Development Environment (IDE), Stride creates a Visual Studio application at the same location on your machine where the new project is saved. This application includes the **Assets**, **Bin**, and **Resources** folders similar to the folders included in a .NET application.
