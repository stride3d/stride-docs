**Textures** are images mainly used in [materials](../materials/index.md). Stride maps textures to the surfaces the material covers.

Textures can add color information to a material â€” for example, to add a brick pattern to a wall or a wood pattern to a table. The values of the pixels in a texture (**texels**) can also be used for other calculations, such as in specular maps, metalness maps, or [normal maps](normal-maps.md). 

Materials typically contain multiple textures; for example, a material might contain a color texture, a normal map texture, and a roughness texture.

Textures can also be used outside materials; for example, you can draw them directly to the UI, or use them in [sprites](../../sprites/index.md).

## Supported file types

You can use the following file types as textures:

* `.dds`
* `.jpg`
* `.jpeg`
* `.png`
* `.gif`
* `.bmp`
* `.tga`
* `.psd`
* `.tif`
* `.tiff`

> [!Note]
> * Stride only imports the first frame of animated image files, such as animated gifs or PNGs. They don't animate in Stride; they appear as static images.
> * Stride currently doesn't support movie files.

## Add a texture

In the **Asset View**, click **Add asset** > **Texture**, then select a template for the texture (**color**, **grayscale** or **normal map**):

![Add texture](media/add-texture.png)

> [!Note]
> Render targets are a different kind of texture, and don't use images. Instead, they render the output from a [camera](../cameras/index.md). For more information, see [Render targets](../graphics-compositor/render-textures.md).

Alternatively, drag the texture file from Explorer to the Asset View:

![Drap and drop a resource file to the Asset View](../get-started/media/create-assets-drop-resource.png)

Then select a texture template (**color**, **grayscale** or **normal map**):
   
![List of asset templates](media/create-assets-drag-drop-select-asset-template.png)

Game Studio adds the texture to the Asset View:

## Texture properties

The following properties are common to all textures.

![Texture properties](media/texture-properties.png)

| Property         | Description
|------------------|---------
| Width            | The width of the texture in-game
| Height           | The height of the texture in-game
| Use percentages    | Use percentages for width and height instead of actual pixel size
| Width            | The width of the texture in-game
| Height           | The height of the texture in-game
| Type             | Use **Color** for textures you want to display as images, **Normal map** for normal maps, and **Grayscale** to provide values for other things (eg specular maps, metalness maps, roughness maps). Color textures and normal maps have additional properties (see below).
| Generate mipmaps | Generate different versions of the texture at different resolutions to be displayed at different distances. Improves performance, removes visual artifacts, and reduces pop-in when using **streaming**, but uses more memory. Unnecessary for textures always at the same distance from the camera (such as UIs).
| Compress         | Compress the final texture to a format based on the target platform and usage. The final texture is a multiple of 4. For more information, see [Texture compression](compression.md).
| Stream         | Stream the texture dynamically at runtime. This improves performance and scene loading times. Not recommended for important textures you always want to be loaded, such as splash screens. For more information, see [Streaming](streaming.md).

### Color texture properties

The following properties apply if you set the texture **type** to **color**.

![Color texture properties](media/color-texture-properties.png)

| Property | Description
|----------|---------
| sRGB sampling | Store the texture in sRGB format and convert to linear space when sampled. Recommended for all color textures, unless they're explicitly in linear space.
| Color key enabled | Use the color set in the **Color key color** property for transparency at runtime. If disabled, the project uses transparent areas of the texture instead
| Color key color | The color used for transparency at runtime. Only applied if **Color key enabled** is selected.
| Alpha | The texture alpha format (**None**, **Mask**, **Explicit**, **Interpolated**, or **Auto**)
| Premultiply alpha |  Premultiply all color components of the images by their alpha component

### Normal map properties

The following property applies if you set the texture **type** to **normal map**.

![Normal map textures](media/normal-map-texture-properties.png)

| Property | Description
|----------|---------
| Invert Y | Have positive Y-component (green) face up in tangent space. This depends on the tools you use to create normal maps.

For more information about normal maps, see the [Normal maps](normal-maps.md) page.

## Grayscale textures

Grayscale texture use only the R channel of the image (finalRGBA = originalRRRR).

>[!Note]
>If you add a texture to a scene (as a sprite component), and set the texture type to grayscale, it appears red, not monochrome. This is because the image uses the R (red) channel.

> To make the channel monochrome, in the **Sprite** component properties, set the **Type** as **Grayscale**. For more information about the sprite component properties, see [Use sprites](../../sprites/use-sprites.md).

You can use grayscale textures to provide values in [material maps](../materials/material-maps.md). For example, you can use a texture as a **blend map** to blend two material layers:

![Blend map diagram](../materials/media/blend-map-diagram.png)

![Blend map diagram](../materials/media/blend-map-diagram2.png)

Note how the blend map texture corresponds to the patterning on the result. 

For more information, see [Material maps](../materials/material-maps.md).

### Global texture settings

For instructions about how to access the global texture settings, see the [Game Settings](../../game-studio/game-settings.md) page.

![Texture settings](../../game-studio/media/texture-settings.png)

| Property        | Description  
|-----------------|--------------
| Texture quality | The texture quality when encoding textures. **Fast** uses the least CPU, but has the lowest quality. Higher settings might result in slower builds, depending on the target platform.
