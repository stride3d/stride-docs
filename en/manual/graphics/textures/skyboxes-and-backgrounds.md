# Skyboxes and backgrounds

**Skyboxes** are backgrounds that create the illusion of space and distance. Typical skybox backgrounds include skies, clouds, mountains, and other scenery. As skyboxes are prerendered, they require little GPU and CPU.

You can use **cubemaps** or **360° panoramic textures** as skyboxes. You can also [use them to light the scene](../lights-and-shadows/skybox-lights.md).

> [!Note]
> Currently, Xenko doesn't support skydomes or local skyboxes.

Alternatively, you can display a **2D background**, which is often useful for 2D games.

## Cubemaps

A **cubemap** is a six-sided texture. When these textures are assembled in a cube around the scene, the cubemap simulates spacious 3D surroundings.

Currently, Game Studio can't convert image files to cubemaps (`.dds` files). Use another application to create a cubemap from separate image files, such as:

* [Nvidia conversion tool](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-texture-tools-adobe-photoshop)
* [ATI conversion tool](http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/archive/games-cgi/cubemapgen)

### Create a cubemap in Game Studio

You can capture a cubemap from a position in your scene.

1. In the **scene editor**, position the camera at the point where you want to capture the cubemap. The direction the camera faces doesn't matter, only the position.

    Typically, you should capture cubemaps at the center of your scene to create the best all-round view.

2. In the scene editor toolbar, open the **Lighting options** menu.

3. Under **Cubemap**, click **Generate**.

4. Browse to the location on disk you want to save the cubemap, specify a name, and click **Save**.

>[!Tip]
>We recommend you save the cubemap in your project **Resources** folder. For more information, see [Organize your files in version control](../../files-and-folders/version-control.md).

Game Studio creates a cubemap `.dds` file in the location you specified.

## 360° panoramic textures

Instead of using a cubemap, you can use a **360° panoramic texture** as a 3D background.

>[!Note]
>Remember that [post effects](../post-effects/index.md) affect the appearance of your skybox. If it doesn't look how you expect, try changing your post effect settings.

## Add a cubemap or 360° panoramic texture to the project

You add these like other color textures.

* In the **Asset View**, click ![Add asset](../lights-and-shadows/media/engine-skybox-add-new-asset-button.png), select **Textures** > **Color texture**, and browse to the file.

    ![Select texture as asset type](media/engine-skybox-select-asset-type.png)

* Alternatively, drag and drop the file from **Windows Explorer** to the **Asset View**, then select **Color texture**.

### Create a skybox

To create a skybox, add a cubemap or 360° panoramic texture to a **background component**.

Xenko includes an entity with a background component in the project by default. Only one background can be active in a scene at a time. If there are multiple backgrounds, Xenko only loads the first.

You can add background components to as many entities as you need. You might want to include more than one background, for example, if you want to switch skyboxes at runtime.

#### Add a background entity

1. In the **Scene view**, select the entity you want to add the component to.

    This can be an empty entity. Its position in the scene doesn't matter.

2. In the **Property Grid** (on the right by default), click **Add component** and select **Background**.

    ![Add background component](media/engine-skybox-add-background-component.png)

3. Under **Texture**, select the cubemap or 360° panoramic texture you want to use in the skybox.

## Use a skybox as a light source

You can use a skybox to light the scene. Xenko analyzes the skybox texture and generates lighting using [image-based lighting (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image-based_lighting). For more information, see [Skybox lights](../lights-and-shadows/skybox-lights.md).

## Change the skybox at runtime

The following code changes the cubemap in a background:

```cs
public Texture cubemapTexture;
public void ChangeBackgroundParameters()
{
    // Get the background component from an entity
	var background = directionalLight.Get<BackgroundComponent>();

	// Replace the existing background
	background.Texture = cubemapTexture;

	// Change the background intensity
	background.Intensity = 1.5f;
}
```

### Convert cubemaps to panoramas and vice versa

Various tools exist to convert a panoramas to cubemaps and vice versa, including: 

- [Panorama Converter](http://gonchar.me/blog/goncharposts/2150)  
- [Panorama to Cubemap](https://jaxry.github.io/panorama-to-cubemap/)
- [Convert Cubemap to Equirectangular](https://www.360toolkit.co/convert-cubemap-to-spherical-equirectangular.html)

## Set a 2D background

Instead of using a 3D skybox, you can display the texture as a static background. This displays the texture as a flat image that stays static no matter how you move the camera. This is often useful for 2D games.

To do this, in the **Background** component properties, select **2D background**.

If you enable this with a cubemap, Xenko uses the first face of the cubemap as the background.

## Use a video as a skybox
