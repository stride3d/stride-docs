# ToneMap

**Tone-mapping** takes an HDR buffer as input, and remaps its color to a [0, 255] range so we can display it on a screen.

There are many ways to remap colors from an HDR space to an LDR, depending on the formula you choose.

Stride supports several tone-mapping operators out of the box:

- Reinhard (the classic operator)
- Exponential
- Logarithmic
- Drago
- Hejl-Dawson
- Mike-Day
- U2-Filmic
