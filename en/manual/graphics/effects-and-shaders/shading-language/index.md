# Shading language

Stride provides a superset of the [HLSL Shading language](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb509561%28v=vs.85%29.aspx), bringing advanced and higher level language constructions, with:

- **extensibility** to allow shaders to be extended easily using object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, inheritance, and composition
- **modularity** to provide a set modular shaders each focusing on a single rendering technique, more easily manageable
- **reusability** to maximize code reuse between shaders

Stride Shading Language (SDSL) is automatically transformed to an existing shading language (HLSL, GLSL, GLSL ES).
