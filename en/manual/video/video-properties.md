|Property   | Description
|-----------| -----------
| Width   | Resize the video width. The value is in a percentage or actual pixel size depending on whether you select **Use percentages**.
| Height  | Resize the video height. The value is in a percentage or actual pixel size depending on whether you select **Use percentages**. 
| Use percentages | Use percentages for the video height and width. If enabled, and the height is set to 100%, Stride displays 100% of the video's actual width. If disabled, the height and width values use pixels, so you can stretch them beyond the video's actual size.
| Trimming | Display only the part of the video you define using the **Start** and **End** times
| Start time | The time to start playing the video from (in seconds, eg `100.500`)
| End time | The time to stop playing the video (in seconds, eg `100.500`)
| Force mono channel | Convert video audio to mono. This is useful when you want the video to use [spatialized audio](../audio/spatialized-audio.md).
