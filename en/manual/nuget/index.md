# Packaging

## Introduction

Since 3.1, Stride is using NuGet format to pack and reference not only the code libraries, but also Stride assets.

As a result, you can:
- [Create a NuGet package](create-packages.md) out of your project to share your Stride assets.
- [Consume a NuGet package](consume-packages.md) by simply referencing it. You can then use its Stride assets.
