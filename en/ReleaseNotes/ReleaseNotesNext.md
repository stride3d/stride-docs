This release includes numerous enhancements and improvements. Here’s what to expect:

### GitHub Pull Request Guidelines

The [GitHub Pull Request Guidelines](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/contributors/contribution-workflow/github-pull-request-guidelines.html) offer comprehensive instructions for crafting pull requests (PRs) that facilitate an efficient review and merge process by the Stride team. These guidelines detail the use of a template that prompts contributors to provide a succinct summary of changes, an in-depth description, any related issues, the motivation behind the changes, the types of changes made, and a thorough checklist to ensure comprehensive testing. Additionally, the guidelines outline the process for prefixing PR titles based on specific labels, categorizing PRs for organizational clarity, and the approach to squashing commits when necessary. A significant focus is also placed on the importance of updating documentation, including API documentation and the user manual, to reflect the latest changes.
