# Stride API

Welcome to the Stride API documentation. These pages contain detailed information about the Stride scripting API, grouped by namespace. The API documentation covers methods, properties, and other relevant information to help you effectively use the Stride engine in your projects.

To make the most out of this section, you should be familiar with scripting concepts and have some experience in programming. If you are new to scripting, we recommend first exploring the [Scripting](../manual/scripts/index.md) pages in the manual, where you'll find an introduction to scripting, as well as essential concepts.

In addition to the Scripting pages, you may also find our [manual](../manual/index.md) helpful in deepening your understanding of Stride and its features.

Feel free to browse the API documentation by namespace, and don't hesitate to consult the [Stride community](https://www.stride3d.net/community/) or [GitHub repository](https://github.com/stride3d/stride) for further assistance and resources.
