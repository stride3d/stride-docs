# Ways to contribute
Stride 3d is a non-profit, community-driven free and open source project.
There are no full-time developers dedicated solely to Stride's advancement; instead, the engine progresses through the voluntary contributions of both the core team and the broader community.

In order to thrive, Stride requires the help from other community members. There are various ways you can help:

### Community activity 🤝
To make Stride3d better, just use it and tell others about it in your blogs, videos, and events. Get involved in discussions on [Discord](https://discord.gg/f6aerfE) and [Github Discussion](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/discussions). Being a user and spreading the word is vital for our engine, as we don't have a big marketing budget and rely on the community to grow.


### Make games 🕹️
The best way to promote Stride is by creating a cool demo or, even better, a full game. Having people see and play an actual game made with Stride is the most effective form of advertisement.


### [Donate](open-collective.md) 💸
We utilize Open Collective for fundraising. The funds collected are allocated towards bug bounties and compensating individuals contracted for paid work.


### [Submit bug reports](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/issues) 🐛
Making Stride more stable greatly improves usability and user satisfaction. So if you encounter a bug during development, please contribute by reporting it on [Github](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/issues).


### [PR reviews](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/pulls) 🔭
