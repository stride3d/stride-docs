# Contribute Code
If you are a developer and you want to help building Stride even more awesome, than you can do so in various ways.

## Check our issue tracker
If you are just getting started with Stride, issues marked with ['good first issue'](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/labels/good%20first%20issue) can be a good entry point.
Please take a look at our [issue tracker](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/issues) for other issues.

We also have funded [Open Collective Projects](https://opencollective.com/stride3d/projects/) in case you want to earn a little extra. These are either Bug bounties

## Notify users
Once you start working on an issue, leave a message on the appropriate issue or create one if none exists to:
* You can always check on Github or Discord if you need to get started somewhere or if you need a general sense of approaching an issue. 
* Make sure that no one else is working on that same issue
* Lay out your plans and discuss it with collaborators and users to make sure it is properly architectured and would fit well in the project

## Coding style
Please use and follow Stride's `.editorconfig` when making changes to files.

## Submitting Changes
* Push your changes to a specific branch in your fork.
* Use that branch to create and fill out a pull request to the official repository.
* After creating that pull request and if it's your first time contributing a [CLA assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/) will ask you to sign the [.NET Founddation Contribution License Agreement](https://dotnetfoundation.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/contribution-license-agreement.pdf?sfvrsn=40626e42_3).
