# Bug bounties
If you are a developer with solid experience in C#, rendering techniques, or game development, we want to hire you! We have allocated funds from supporters on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/stride3d) and will pay you for your work on certain issues.

You can find [issues with bounties here](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/labels/bounty). If you see a different bug that you would like to tackle and you want to know if it is eligible for a bug bounty, you are also more than welcome to reach out to the core contributors on [Discord](https://discord.gg/f6aerfE) and [Github Discussion](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/discussions).

If you are interested in tackling one of those issues:
- Reply in the thread and tag @stride3d/stride-contributors
- We'll get back to you and reserve that issue to your name.
- You can then create a new pull request and we'll review it.
- Once merged in you will receive 60% of the bounty and the other 40% on the next official release of the engine.


## Payment info
Stride uses the Open source collective as our Fiscal host which approves the payments. They process payouts twice weekly, once they have been approved by the admins of the Collective. They make payments via PayPal and Wise, and can only make payouts to countries served by these payment processors.
