# Roadmap

The Stride game engine (MIT) is a collaborative endeavor managed by a small group of core volunteer developers, each with expertise in different areas of development. There are no full-time developers solely focused on Stride's advancement; instead, the engine progresses through the voluntary contributions of both the [core team](core-team.md) and the wider community. These individuals dedicate their spare time to enhance and expand the engine, driven by personal interest, passion for the project, or their areas of expertise.

## Contributors

Contributions to Stride come in various forms. Some contributors focus on addressing [existing issues](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/issues) to improve stability and usability. Others explore new features or improvements they find valuable, intriguing, or hold expertise in.

## Community Roadmap

The community has highlighted a range of feature requests, some of which are quite extensive and of an epic nature, requiring a long-term commitment from developers to complete. These larger goals form a "Community Roadmap" of sorts, reflecting the volunteer-driven nature of Stride's development process.

You can view the current list of feature requests, to-dos, and in-progress tasks on the [Community Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/stride3d/projects/13).

## Open Collective

Because all contributions to Stride are voluntary, the pace of development largely depends on each contributorâ€™s personal bandwidth and interests. To help prioritize or incentivize certain features, Stride maintains bounties through the [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/stride3d/projects). These bounties encourage and reward contributors for tackling specific community requests.
