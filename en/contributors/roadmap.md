# Roadmap
The Stride game engine (MIT) is a collaborative endeavor managed by a small group of core volunteer developers, each with expertise in different areas of development. There are no full-time developers dedicated solely to Stride's advancement; instead, the engine progresses through the voluntary contributions of both the core team and the broader community. These individuals dedicate their spare time to enhance and expand the engine, motivated by personal interest, passion for the project, or their areas of expertise.

## Contributors
Contributions to Stride come in various forms. Some contributors focus on resolving existing issues, fostering the engine's stability and usability. Others venture into new territories, introducing improvements and features they deem beneficial, are personally intrigued by, or hold expertise in.

## Community Roadmap and Open Collective
The community has highlighted a range of feature requests, some of which are quite extensive of an Epic nature, requiring a long-term commitment from developers to complete. These larger goals form a "Community Roadmap" of sorts, reflecting the volunteer-driven nature of Stride's development process.

Given the voluntary nature of contributions, the pace of progress hinges largely on the personal commitments and availability of our contributors. However, to catalyze action around certain desired features, Stride has established bounties through the [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/stride3d). These bounties serve as a rallying call, incentivizing efforts towards tackling specific requests.
