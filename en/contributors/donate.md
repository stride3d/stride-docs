# Donating to Stride
In order to support our contributors or if we want to finance a specific feature, we collect donations from individuals as well as organisations. 

## Open Collective
We gather funding through a website called [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/stride3d). This website displays where all the money is coming from and where it is going to: 100% transparency guaranteed.

## Projects
Stride's Open Collective hosts different '[Projects](https://opencollective.com/stride3d/projects)' — think of them as funding goals for specific features or contributions. Each project typically has a related GitHub ticket for more details on what's required for its development. If you're interested in working on or contributing to a particular feature, you can let us know by either replying:
 - In each projects related Github thread and mention @stride3d/stride-contributors 
 - In the Stride [Contributors channel on Discord](https://discord.gg/bDhMhGVHvD).
