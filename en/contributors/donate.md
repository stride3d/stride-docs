# Donating to Stride
In order to support our contributors or if we want to finance a specific feature, we collect donations from individuals as well as organisations. 

## Open Collective
We gather funding through a website called [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/stride3d). This website displays were al the money is coming from and where it is going to: 100% transparency guaranteed.

## Projects
Stride's Open Collective hosts different '[Projects](https://opencollective.com/stride3d/projects)' — think of them as funding goals for specific features or contributions. Each project typically has a related Github ticket for more details on what's required for its development. If you're interested in working on or contributing to a particular feature, please reply in the thread and mention @stride3d/stride-contributors.


## Bug bounties
If you are a developer with experience in C#, rendering techniques, or game development, we want to hire you! We have allocated funds from supporters on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/stride3d) and will pay you for your work on certain issues.

You can find [issues with bounties here](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/labels/bounty)

If you are interested in tackling one of those issues:
- Reply in the thread and tag @stride3d/stride-contributors
- We'll get back to you and reserve that issue to your name.
- You can then create a new pull request and we'll review it.
- Once merged in you will receive 60% of the bounty and the other 40% on the next official release of the engine.


### Payment info
Stride uses the [Open source collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource) as our Fiscal host which approves the payments. They process payouts twice weekly, once they have been approved by the admins of the Collective. They make payments via PayPal and Wise, and can only make payouts to countries served by these payment processors.
