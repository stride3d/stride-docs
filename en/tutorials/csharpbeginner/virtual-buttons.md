# Virtual buttons
You can find this sample in the tutorial project: **Menu** -> **Virtual buttons** 

## Explanation
This C# Beginner tutorial covers how to create virtual buttons. Lets say that you want a player to jump when a key is pressed. The spacebar is a common option, but what if a gamer wants to have a different key bind to this 'Jump' action. The answer here is the 'Virtual button'. Virtual buttons allow the mapping of 1 or more keyboard keys, mousebuttons or joystick buttons to a single 'Virtual button'. We can check for the name of that virtual button to see if any of the virtual button are triggered.
