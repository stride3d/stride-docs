# Virtual buttons
You can find this sample in the tutorial project: **Menu** -> **Virtual buttons** 

## Explanation
This C# Beginner tutorial covers how to create virtual buttons. Lets say that you want a player to jump when a key is pressed. The space bar is a common option, but what if a gamer wants to have a different key bind to this 'Jump' action? The answer here is the 'Virtual button'. Virtual buttons allow the mapping of one or more keyboard keys, mouse buttons or joystick buttons to a single 'Virtual button'. We can check for the name of that virtual button to see if any of the virtual buttons are triggered.
