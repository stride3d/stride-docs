# Importing resources

In this tutorial, we will learn how to import resources into Stride game studio using two different methods:

- Creating an asset via the Asset View, or 
- Dragging and dropping files directly from a folder 
 
We also learn how important it is that we keep our resources in a projects resources folder, rather than having them scattered across our computer.
